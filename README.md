A **SmartCar** is a self-driving and self-learning car that can move around in the city at top speed without running into anything. It's a car, from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. The goal of this virtual self-learning SmartCar is to drive around an environment for as long as possible without hitting anything.

We are be using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn for the machine learning and Pygame and Pymunk for the game.
